          Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela; born Rolihlahla Mandela; 18 July 1918 – 5December 2013) 
          was a South African anti-apartheid activist and politician who served as the first 
          president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head 
          of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. 
          His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by fostering racial 
          reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the 
          president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.

            A Xhosa, Mandela was born into the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, South Africa. 
            He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand 
            before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial 
            and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth 
            League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, 
            a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, Mandela and the ANC committed 
            themselves to its overthrow. He was appointed president of the ANC's Transvaal branch, 
            rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress 
            of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully 
            prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned 
            South African Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, 
            in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant uMkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 that led 
            a sabotage campaign against the apartheid government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, 
            and, following the Rivonia Trial, was sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state.

            Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison and Victor 
            Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure and fears of racial civil 
            war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate 
            an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led 
            the ANC to victory and became president. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated 
            a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and 
            created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. 
            Economically, his administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own 
            socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty and expand 
            healthcare services. Internationally, Mandela acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing 
            trial and served as secretary-general of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined 
            a second presidential term and was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder 
            statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.

            Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on the right denounced him as 
            a communist terrorist and those on the far left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with 
            apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. Globally regarded as an icon of democracy 
            and social justice, he received more than 250 honours, including the Nobel Peace Prize. He is held in deep respect 
            within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Thembu clan name, Madiba, and described as the "Father of the Nation".

            <h1>Reception and legacy</h1>
            By the time of his death, within South Africa Mandela was widely considered both "the father of the nation" and "the founding 
            father of democracy". Outside of South Africa, he was a "global icon", with the scholar of South African studies Rita Barnard 
            describing him as "one of the most revered figures of our time". One biographer considered him "a modern democratic hero". 
            Some have portrayed Mandela in messianic terms, in contrast to his own statement that "I was not a messiah, but an ordinary man 
            who had become a leader because of extraordinary circumstances." He is often cited alongside Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. 
            as one of the 20th century's exemplary anti-racist and anti-colonial leaders.[445] Boehmer described him as "a totem of the totemic values 
            of our age: toleration and liberal democracy" and "a universal symbol of social justice".

            Mandela's international fame emerged during his incarceration in the 1980s, when he became the world's most famous political prisoner, 
            a symbol of the anti-apartheid cause, and an icon for millions who embraced the ideal of human equality. In 1986, Mandela's biographer 
            characterised him as "the embodiment of the struggle for liberation" in South Africa. Meredith stated that in becoming "a potent symbol 
            of resistance" to apartheid during the 1980s, he had gained "mythical status" internationally. Sampson commented that even during his life, 
            this myth had become "so powerful that it blurs the realities", converting Mandela into "a secular saint". Within a decade of the end of his 
            presidency, Mandela's era was widely thought of as "a golden age of hope and harmony", with much nostalgia being expressed for it. His name 
            was often invoked by those criticising his successors like Mbeki and Zuma. Across the world, Mandela earned international acclaim for his 
            activism in overcoming apartheid and fostering racial reconciliation, coming to be viewed as "a moral authority" with a great "concern for 
            truth". Mandela's iconic status has been blamed for concealing the complexities of his life.

            Mandela generated controversy throughout his career as an activist and politician, having detractors on both the right and the radical left. 
            During the 1980s, Mandela was widely labelled a terrorist by prominent political figures in the Western world for his embrace of political violence. 
            According to Thatcher, for instance, the ANC was "a typical terrorist organisation". The US government's State and Defense departments officially 
            designated the ANC as a terrorist organisation, resulting in Mandela remaining on their terrorism watch-list until 2008.[463] On the left, some 
            voices in the ANC—among them Frank B. Wilderson III—accused him of selling out for agreeing to enter negotiations with the apartheid government 
            and for not implementing the reforms of the Freedom Charter during his presidency.[464] According to Barnard, "there is also a sense in which his 
            chiefly bearing and mode of conduct, the very respect and authority he accrued in representing his nation in his own person, went against 
            the spirit of democracy", and concerns were similarly expressed that he placed his own status and celebrity above the transformation of 
            his country. His government would be criticised for its failure to deal with both the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the high levels of poverty in South Africa.

            <h1>Orders, decorations, monuments, and honours</h1>
            Over the course of his life, Mandela was given over 250 awards, accolades, prizes, honorary degrees and citizenships in recognition of his political achievements. 
            Among his awards were the Nobel Peace Prize, the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Soviet Union's Lenin Peace Prize, and the Libyan Al-Gaddafi International 
            Prize for Human Rights. In 1990, India awarded him the Bharat Ratna, and in 1992 Pakistan gave him their Nishan-e-Pakistan. The same year, he was awarded the Atatürk 
            Peace Award by Turkey; he at first refused the award, citing human rights violations committed by Turkey at the time, but later accepted the award in 1999. 
            He was appointed to the Order of Isabella the Catholic and the Order of Canada, and was the first living person to be made an honorary Canadian citizen. 
            Queen Elizabeth II appointed him as a Bailiff Grand Cross of the Order of St. John and granted him membership in the Order of Merit.

            In 2004, Johannesburg granted Mandela the Freedom of the City, and in 2008 a Mandela statue was unveiled at the spot where Mandela was released from prison. 
            On the Day of Reconciliation 2013, a bronze statue of Mandela was unveiled at Pretoria's Union Buildings. In November 2009, the United Nations General Assembly 
            proclaimed Mandela's birthday, 18 July, as "Mandela Day", marking his contribution to the anti-apartheid struggle. It called on individuals to donate 67 minutes 
            to doing something for others, commemorating the 67 years that Mandela had been a part of the movement. In 2015 the UN General Assembly named the amended Standard 
            Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners as "the Mandela Rules" to honour his legacy.[480] Subsequently, the years 2019 to 2028 were also designated the United 
            Nations Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace.

            <h1>Biographies and popular media</h1>
            The first biography of Mandela was based on brief interviews with him that the author, Mary Benson, had conducted in the 1960s. Two authorised biographies were 
            later produced by friends of Mandela. The first was Fatima Meer's Higher Than Hope, which was heavily influenced by Winnie and thus placed great emphasis on 
            Mandela's family. The second was Anthony Sampson's Mandela, published in 1999. Other biographies included Martin Meredith's Mandela, first published in 1997, 
            and Tom Lodge's Mandela, brought out in 2006.

            Since the late 1980s, Mandela's image began to appear on a proliferation of items, among them "photographs, paintings, drawings, statues, public murals, buttons, 
            t-shirts, refrigerator magnets, and more", items that have been characterised as "Mandela kitsch".[486] In the 1980s he was the subject of several songs, such as 
            The Specials' "Free Nelson Mandela", Hugh Masekela's "Bring Him Back Home (Nelson Mandela)", and Johnny Clegg's "Asimbonanga (Mandela)", which helped to bring 
            awareness of his imprisonment to an international audience.

            Mandela has also been depicted in films on multiple occasions. Some of these, such as the 2013 feature film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, the 2017 miniseries 
            Madiba and the 1996 documentary Mandela, have focused on covering his adult life in entirety or until his inaugural as president. Others, such as the 2009 feature 
            film Invictus and the 2010 documentary The 16th Man, have focused on specific events in his life. Lukhele has argued that in Invictus and other films, "the America 
            film industry" has played a significant part in "the crafting of Mandela's global image".
